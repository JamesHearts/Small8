The Small8 is a tiny 8-bit processor based on GCPU architecture.

The processor works as needed, however there is much room for improvement. This code is for educational and reference purposes only, use at your own risk.

The MIFS folder contains test files.
The Entities folder contains all synthesizable VHDL code.
The decoder7seg is used if you want to program the processor to a CYCLONE III FPGA.
